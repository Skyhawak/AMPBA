Humor_Detection 
This project titled "Humor Detection". The project primarily focuses on exploring humor detection in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It discusses the motivation, relevance, theoretical and technical background, and applications in various sectors like business, education, and entertainment. The project aims to develop computational techniques to detect humor, addressing the challenge of understanding and replicating this uniquely human trait using machine learning and NLP methods

My Solution
Our problem is to define if a given sentence is Humorous statement or not and this deals with the NLP (Text analytics) classification techniques.
We zeroed on to use distilbert-base-uncased which is a specific variant of the DistillBERT pre-trained model which was built on a large corpus of text data.
DistillBERTs a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model developed by Hugging Face.
DistilBERT achieves this by applying a technique called knowledge distillation, where a larger pre-trained model (such as BERT) is used to train a smaller model (DistilBERT).
